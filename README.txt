7400 Series 7 Segment Counter

Simple counter based on the 74191 up/down counter and 7447 BCD to 7 segment driver logic chips.

Input can be provided by 4 DIP switches, a load button, and a clock button. It would not take much work at all to add a 555 timer in order to generate clock pulses for the 74191. The clock button has no debouncing, so the counter may increment more than one number when pushed.
